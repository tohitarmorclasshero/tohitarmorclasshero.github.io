An illusion by some kind of illusionist And at the very beginning, they gave the game away through a keen eye that they were interacting with the surroundings to control the illusion. For example, some kind of control panel. This could be a great idea for an encounter within the campaign. An illusionist that uses some kind of spell to control the surroundings and the party has to find the thing they're interacting with to break the spell.
