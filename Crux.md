# 1 CRUX

#### GODS AT THE SOURCE
All magic in Crux flows from the Divine Age. As in Greek mythology, all supernatural or fantastical elements in Crux -- monsters, magic, even your heroic powers -- are believed to ultimately stem from an antediluvian time of gods & titans.

#### ANCIENT MAGIC
Though spells in Crux are familiar, the style of magic is mythic rather than medieval. To this end, we encourage you to instill your spells with mythic flavor; instead of the spell spirit guardians conjuring angelic figures, it could instead summon a host of spectral hoplites, the spirits of your ancestors or fallen comrades, their arms & armor still scarred & pitted from their final battle.

#### MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD
Crux has very little metal available for tools. Many weapons, armor, & items are different than those you would find in traditional fantasy. Instead of rapiers & crossbows on Crux, expect spears & slings. This means the people have had to either come up with alternate ways of making the things other low-technology societies make out of metal, or use much less metal in making them. Coins for example are very small amber disks. A substitute for steel exists: the chitin of large bugs called chlén, boiled and treated with secret chemicals and processes, yields a material roughly as hard and flexible as bronze and light as lacquered fibreglass. Chlén isn’t as strong as steel, and doesn’t hold an edge as well, but it’s lighter, much cheaper, and gets the job done.

#### Transportation Troubles
There are no animals suitable for riding on Crux. The creatures are a bizarre mix; in addition to the native wildlife, all of the species that settled the world, including humans, brought animals from their homeworlds. When the planet fell from it's technological plateau, all these creatures were released into the wild to fight it out for whatever ecological niches were available. None of the traditional riding beasts survived. Nowadays you either walk, get carried in a litter or palanquin, or ride on a wheelbarrow or rickshaw.

#### Don’t Leave the Trail
Another comment on the flora and fauna — the nastiest ones won the competition. Forests are more like jungles, and they’re extremely dangerous. Swamps are unspeakably threatening, with insects large enough to carry off small children and drill holes through adults. Even a brief walk through a city or town isn't completely without danger.

#### It’s Not Just the Humidity....
Crux is hot. The northern reaches of are as hot as equatorial Earth, the Southern cities are hotter still, and the climate at the equator is unbearable for humans. People deal with the heat by staying indoors at the hottest times of day (they become almost nocturnal in the Southern cities in Summer) and dressing appropriately. Fortunately, the humidity isn’t too bad outside of the swamps, which are truly hellish.
