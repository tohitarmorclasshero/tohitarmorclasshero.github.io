# 1 CRUX

#### GODS AT THE SOURCE
All magic in Crux flows from the Divine Age. As in Greek mythology, all supernatural or fantastical elements in Crux -- monsters, magic, even your heroic powers -- are believed to ultimately stem from an antediluvian time of gods & titans.

#### ANCIENT MAGIC
Though spells in Crux are familiar, the style of magic is mythic rather than medieval. To this end, we encourage you to instill your spells with mythic flavor; instead of the spell spirit guardians conjuring angelic figures, it could instead summon a host of spectral hoplites, the spirits of your ancestors or fallen comrades, their arms & armor still scarred & pitted from their final battle.

#### MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD
Crux has very little metal available for tools. Many weapons, armor, & items are different than those you would find in traditional fantasy. Instead of rapiers & crossbows on Crux, expect spears & slings.
