# CRUX

#### Gods At The Source
All magic in Crux flows from the Divine Age. As in Greek mythology, all supernatural or fantastical elements in Crux -- monsters, magic, even your heroic powers -- are believed to ultimately stem from an antediluvian time of gods & titans.

#### Ancient Magic
The world crackles with magic, raw and untamed. It's the dawn of many worlds, and magic is mysterious, scarcely understood, feared, and revered. The clans wield magic as best they can to survive and create a future for themselves, but they do so knowing that they're touching the edge of something far larger and more dangerous than they can possibly imagine.

Though spells in Crux are familiar, the style of magic is mythic rather than medieval. To this end, we encourage you to instill your spells with mythic flavor; instead of the spell spirit guardians conjuring angelic figures, it could instead summon a host of spectral hoplites, the spirits of your ancestors or fallen comrades, their arms & armor still scarred & pitted from their final battle.

#### More Precious Than Gold
Crux has very little metal available for tools. Many weapons, armor, & items are different than those you would find in traditional fantasy. Instead of rapiers & crossbows on Crux, expect spears & slings. This means the people have had to either come up with alternate ways of making the things other low-technology societies make out of metal, or use much less metal in making them. Coins for example are very small amber disks. A substitute for steel exists: the chitin of large bugs called chlén, boiled and treated with secret chemicals and processes, yields a material roughly as hard and flexible as bronze and light as lacquered fibreglass. Chlén isn’t as strong as steel, and doesn’t hold an edge as well, but it’s lighter, much cheaper, and gets the job done.

#### Transportation Troubles
There are no animals suitable for riding on Crux. The creatures are a bizarre mix; in addition to the native wildlife, all of the species that settled the world, including humans, brought animals from their homeworlds. When the planet fell from it's technological plateau, all these creatures were released into the wild to fight it out for whatever ecological niches were available. None of the traditional riding beasts survived. Nowadays you either walk, get carried in a litter or palanquin, or ride on a wheelbarrow or rickshaw.

#### Don’t Leave the Trail
Another comment on the flora and fauna — the nastiest ones won the competition. Forests are more like jungles, and they’re extremely dangerous. Swamps are unspeakably threatening, with insects large enough to carry off small children and drill holes through adults. Even a brief walk through a city or town isn't completely without danger.

#### It’s Not Just the Humidity....
Crux is hot. The northern reaches of are as hot as equatorial Earth, the Southern cities are hotter still, and the climate at the equator is unbearable for humans. People deal with the heat by staying indoors at the hottest times of day (they become almost nocturnal in the Southern cities in Summer) and dressing appropriately. Fortunately, the humidity isn’t too bad outside of the swamps, which are truly hellish.

#### Gods Barter
Since they are confined to their hallows and hungry for glory, gods are more than willing to help mortals -- even passing strangers -- in exchange for offerings and favors. The hallows of gods can take the place of a magic shop, where food and drink are blessed, totems are crafted, and weapons, armor, and other wondrous items are enchanted... for the right offering.

#### Gods Consume
Some gods are content to remain in their hallows and commune with followers, but most strive to grow their power and influence. Gods incite their zealots to conquer neighbors, destroy their sacred places -- dam rivers, cut trees, hunt animals, etc. -- to weaken them so the conquering god can extend their influence and power.

#### Craft What You Need
In this primal world, mortals make what they need from a hunt's harvest or what they can gather from the wild. The land and its monsters bristle with parts that can be used in all manner of surprising combinations, from the simplest knife to elaborate flying constructs built from driftstone, leathery wings, scavenged ribcages, and arcane gems. It's a make-do land, where cunning and ingenuity are as valuable as brawn and stamina, and every hunt is an opportunity for invention.

#### Hunter-Gatherers
While the cities have their own methods, those that live in the wilderness are forced to survive in other ways. Because permanent settlement & farming attracts the ire of roving forests and beasts, the clans are forced into a nomadic lifestyle; following prey, setting traps, fishing, and gathering the produce of the land to stay alive.

#### Shifting Passages
The world doesn't stay still. Even a clan who's found passways through the world may find that they change from year to year. All most clans know is that certain ways in the world lead to clear skies and good hunting. But it is the work of such clans to relocate the passages each year as the seasons shift. Magical portals, forest trails, and mountain passes alike can close or relocate, or the conditions of opening them alter. Such a change too late in the year can spell disaster for even a powerful clan, leaving them at the mercy of the elements without warning.

#### Before the Planes
The planes of existence haven't yet separated, and all the magic of the elements, the world's birth, and the potential of the multiverse exists in one great land. From the volcanic fires of creation in Blood Mountain to the raw powers of the Elemental Wastes and -- beyond that -- the Sea of Fallen Stars, magic is everywhere. The Kingdom of the Dead and the Dreamlands are a step away, and their magic seeps into the world as well. All things are possible, close, full of promise and menace.

#### Strange Lore
There is much in the world that is not understood -- taboo places with weird magic energies that shamans and sorcerers can't explain. Strange pits or doors into the earth conceal buried secrets, cultists practice unknowable rites at the edge of the world, giants work strange, too-powerful magics, elemental spirits of the Wastes spin new realities from whims...such things are beyond the understanding of the clans. Yet there are those who are drawn by such mysteries, and certain wanderers spend their lives delving into these exact secrets to discover what good or evil they hold.
