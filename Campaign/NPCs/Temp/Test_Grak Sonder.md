## History

Grak was born in Onyxdale to an orc father and a human mother. Growing up in the rough neighbourhoods of Onyxdale, Grak learned to fend for himself at an early age. His physical strength and orcish heritage made him a natural fit for the local gangs, and he quickly became associated with "The Hushed."

Over the years, Grak earned his place in the gang through his loyalty, resilience, and combat skills. Despite the shady nature of their activities, Grak found a sense of camaraderie and purpose among the gang members. He became known for his stoic demeanour and his willingness to take on any task assigned to him, whether it was intimidation, theft, or more clandestine operations.

Grak's understanding of both cultures also made him an effective mediator within the gang, helping to prevent internal conflicts.

As "The Hushed" works to establish dominance in Onyxdale, Grak serves as one of its enforcers. He is respected by his peers and feared by rivals, making him a valuable asset to the gang's operations. Grak's personal journey is one of seeking acceptance and a place to call home in a city that often marginalizes those who are different.
